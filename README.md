Here I used EJS, Mongo DB, Express, and Node to make a full stack app for Sushi Restaurant Employees to keep track of orders

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Mongo DB, Express, and Node

I used an express server on top of Node, with routes to each of my EJS templates and forms. I connected to Mondo DB with Mongoose and there I store the orders on the site. 

## Lessons Learned:

It was a great learning experience using Express and Mongo DB as well as authentication
